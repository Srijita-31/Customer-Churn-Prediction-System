#  Customer Churn Prediction System

## üåü Project Overview

This project implements a complete **Techno-Functional Customer Churn Prediction System**. It uses machine learning to identify customers at high risk of leaving (churning) and translates the raw prediction probability into **actionable business risk categories (Low, Medium, High)**.

The goal is to enable the Customer Success team to execute targeted, proactive retention strategies *before* the customer is lost.

## Live Application:

The most crucial output is the live, interactive web application.

##  Functional Insights:

The model uses **Logistic Regression** not just for prediction, but for its **interpretability**. By analyzing the coefficients, we identified the key drivers of customer behavior:

| Category | Strongest Predictors (High Risk) | Strongest Retention Factors (Low Risk) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Commitment** | **Month-to-month contract** (Highest risk factor) | **Two-year contract** (Strongest retention factor) |
| **Support/Value**| Lack of **Tech Support** | Use of **Tech Support** |
| **Demographics**| **Senior Citizen** status | Long **Tenure** (high months as customer) |

### **Risk-Action Matrix**

The application automates business decisions based on the predicted probability:

| Risk Level | Probability Threshold | Action Triggered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Low (Green)** | $\le 30\%$ | Monitor. |
| **Medium (Yellow)** | $30\% - 60\%$ | Automated follow-up email/survey. |
| **High (Red)** | $> 60\%$ | **Proactive Action Triggered:** Auto-assign to Customer Success Team for personalized outreach. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### **Data & Modeling**

* **Dataset:** Telco Customer Churn dataset.
* **Model:** **Logistic Regression**. Chosen for its stability and interpretability (coefficient analysis).
* **Metrics:** Focused on achieving high **Precision** (minimizing false positives to avoid wasting retention efforts) and **Recall** (minimizing false negatives to catch as many at-risk customers as possible).

### **Architecture & Deployment**

The project follows a standard MLOps-ready structure:
